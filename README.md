## Specifications

| behavior |  input   |  output  |
|----------|:--------:|:--------:|
|Program will take the user input number and return the number | 1 | N/A |
|Program will take the user input and check to see if divisible by 128 return the modulo.  If so, program with output "cat"| 128 | "cat" |
|Program will take the modulo and check to see if divisible by 64 return the new modulo.  If so, program with output "pollen"| 128 | "cat" |
|Program will loop through and continue to check if new modulo is divisible by 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, returning the new modulo each time through the loop.  For each number, the program will output the corresponding allergy (chocolate, tomatoes, strawberries, shellfish, peanuts, egg) | 134 | "cat", "shellfish", "peanuts" |
